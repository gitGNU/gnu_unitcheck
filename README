                        -----------------

AUTHENTICATION:
Authentication is becoming a necessity. It will be implemented soon.

ADD TESTS:
Adding tests is as simple as calling a function from your test script.

PROJECT TESTS:
Project tests are held in the tests/ directory.
For proper operation, they require the import of all project resources.
